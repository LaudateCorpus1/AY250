	abstract = {Using microstimulation to imprint meaningful activity patterns into intrinsically highly interconnected neuronal substrates is hampered by activation of fibers of passage leading to a spatiotemporal blur of activity. The focus of the present study was to characterize the shape of this blur in the neocortex to arrive at an estimate of the resolution with which signals can be transmitted by multielectrode stimulation. The horizontal spread of significant unit activity evoked by near-threshold focal electrical stimulation (charge transfer 0.8-4.8 {nC)} and multielectrode recording in the face representation of the primary somatosensory cortex of ketamine anesthetized rats was determined to be about 1,350 {micro}m. The evoked activity inside this range consisted in a sequence of fast excitatory response followed by an inhibition lasting {\textgreater}100 ms. These 2 responses could not be separated by varying the intensity of stimulation while a slow excitatory rebound after the inhibitory response was restricted to higher stimulus intensities ({\textgreater}2.4 {nC).} Stimulation frequencies of 20 and 40 Hz evoked repetitive excitatory response standing out against a continuous background of inhibition. At 5- and {10-Hz} stimulation, the inhibitory response showed a complex interaction pattern attributed to highly sublinear superposition of individual inhibitory responses. The present data help to elucidate the neuronal underpinnings of behavioral effects of microstimulation. Furthermore, they provide essential information to determine spatiotemporal constraints for purposeful multielectrode stimulation in the neocortex.},

The learning curves for individual subjects show an abrupt, often step-like increase from the untrained level of responding to the level seen in the well trained subject. The rise is at least as abrupt as that commonly seen in psychometric functions in stimulus detection experiments. It may indicate that the appearance of conditioned behavior is mediated by an evidence-based decision process, as in stimulus detection experiments. If the appearance of conditioned behavior is taken instead to reflect the increase in an underlying associative strength, then a negligible portion of the function relating associative strength to amount of experience is behaviorally visible. Consequently, rate of learning cannot be estimated from the group-average curve; the best measure is latency to the onset of responding, determined for each subject individually.},

	abstract = {In Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning, reward typically comes seconds after reward-triggering actions, creating an explanatory conundrum known as distal reward problem": How does the brain know what firing patterns of what neurons are responsible for the reward if 1) the patterns are no longer there when the reward arrives and 2) all neurons and synapses are active during the waiting period to the reward? Here, we show how the conundrum is resolved by a model network of cortical spiking neurons with spike-timing-dependent plasticity {(STDP)} modulated by dopamine {(DA).} Although {STDP} is triggered by nearly coincident firing patterns on a millisecond timescale, slow kinetics of subsequent synaptic plasticity is sensitive to changes in the extracellular {DA} concentration during the critical period of a few seconds. Random firings during the waiting period to the reward do not affect {STDP} and hence make the network insensitive to the ongoing activity--the key feature that distinguishes our approach from previous theoretical studies, which implicitly assume that the network be quiet during the waiting period or that the patterns be preserved until the reward arrives. This study emphasizes the importance of precise firing patterns in brain dynamics and suggests how a global diffusive reinforcement signal in the form of extracellular {DA} can selectively influence the right synapses at the right time.},

	abstract = {Presents a statistical configuration theory which proposes that the common mode of activity in massive numbers of neurons in anatomically extensive systems represents information about a learned experience. Different brain regions share a common mode during learning. When an experienced organism receives a novel and meaningless stimulus and generalization occurs, this new afferent input in a familiar context activates the representational system causing release of a common activity mode like that stored during the learning experience. Moreover, this released activity is not attributable to the numerous unspecific factors investigated, and seems to reflect the memory of that experience. The relationship between the temporal distribution of release of a specific waveshape and subsequent occurrence of the appropriate behavior was found to be highly nonrandom. Results of a series of experiments with 25 trained cats, and analogous data taken from studies with human Ss, are compatible with the proposed theory and are difficult to reconcile with switchboard and place theories of learning which lack comparable empirical evidence. Findings suggest that the subjective experience of remembering is correlated with the release of readout processes, and it is hypothesized that coherent temporal patterns in the average activity of anatomically extensive neural ensembles may constitute the neurophysiological basis of subjective experience.

	abstract = {Successful decision making requires an ability to monitor contexts, actions, and outcomes. The anterior cingulate cortex {(ACC)} is thought to be critical for these functions, monitoring and guiding decisions especially in challenging situations involving conflict and errors. A number of different single-unit correlates have been observed in the {ACC} that reflect the diverse cognitive components involved. Yet how {ACC} neurons function as an integrated network is poorly understood. Here we show, using advanced population analysis of multiple single-unit recordings from the rat {ACC} during performance of an ecologically valid decision-making task, that ensembles of neurons move through different coherent and dissociable states as the cognitive requirements of the task change. This organization into distinct network patterns with respect to both firing-rate changes and correlations among units broke down during trials with numerous behavioral errors, especially at choice points of the task. These results point to an underlying functional organization into cell assemblies in the {ACC} that may monitor choices, outcomes, and task contexts, thus tracking the animal's progression through task space.},

	abstract = {The principles of statistical mechanics and information theory play an important role in learning
and have inspired both theory and the design of numerous machine learning algorithms. The new aspect
in this paper is a focus on integrating feedback from the learner. A quantitative approach to
interactive learning and adaptive behavior is proposed, integrating model- and decision-making into
one theoretical framework. This paper follows simple principles by requiring that the observer's
world model and action policy should result in maximal predictive power at minimal complexity.
Classes of optimal action policies and of optimal models are derived from an objective function that
reflects this trade-off between prediction and complexity. The resulting optimal models then
summarize, at different levels of abstraction, the process's causal organization in the presence of
the learner's actions. A fundamental consequence of the proposed principle is that the learner's
optimal action policies balance exploration and control as an emerging property. Interestingly, the
explorative component is present in the absence of policy randomness, i.e. in the optimal
deterministic behavior. This is a direct result of requiring maximal predictive power in the
presence of feedback.},

	abstract = {Reinforcement learning, one of the most active research areas in artificial
intelligence, is a computational approach to learning whereby an agent tries
to maximize the total amount of reward it receives when interacting with a
complex, uncertain environment. In {\_Reinforcement} Learning\_, Richard Sutton
and Andrew Barto provide a clear and simple account of the key ideas and
algorithms of reinforcement learning. Their discussion ranges from the history
of the field's intellectual foundations to the most recent developments and
applications. The only necessary mathematical background is familiarity with
elementary concepts of probability. The book is divided into three parts. Part
I defines the reinforcement learning problem in terms of Markov decision
processes. Part {II} provides basic solution methods: dynamic programming, Monte
Carlo methods, and temporal-difference learning. Part {III} presents a unified
view of the solution methods and incorporates artificial neural networks,
eligibility traces, and planning; the two final chapters present case studies
and consider the future of reinforcement learning.},

	abstract = {Simultaneous behavior and multielectrode neural recordings in freely behaving rodents holds great promise to investigate the neural bases of behavior and to study disease models in combination with genetic manipulations. Here, we introduce the use of three-axis accelerometers to characterize the behavior of rats and mice during chronic neural recordings. These sensors were small and light enough to be worn by rodents and were used to record three-axis acceleration during freely moving behavior. A two layer neural network based pattern recognition algorithm was developed to extract the natural behavior of mice from the acceleration data. Successful recognition of resting, eating, grooming and rearing are demonstrated using this approach. The inertial sensors were then combined with continuous twenty-four hour recordings of neural data from the striatum of mice to characterize variations in neural activity with circadian cycles, and to investigate the neural correlates of spontaneous action initiation. Finally, accelerometers were used to study the performance of rodents in traditional operant conditioning, where they were used to extract the reaction time of rodents. Thus the addition of accelerometer recordings of rodents to chronic multielectrode neural recordings provides great value for a number of neuroscience applications.},
